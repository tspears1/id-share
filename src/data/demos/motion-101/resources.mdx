## Libraries

In my opinion there are really three big players in the world of motion design javascript libraries:

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
### **Matt Perry**
Creator of Framer Motion, PopMotion and the newer <a href="https://motion.dev/" target="_blank">Motion</a> (previously known as Motion One)
Matt's work has been focused on creating React motion libraries however the newest iteration now uses the same engine for a vanilla Javascript version.
Strong declaritive API, incredible performance but lacking when it comes to timeline features.

### **Julian Garnier**
Creator of <a href="https://animejs.com/" target="_blank">AnimeJS</a>.
The library is lightweight, quick to learn and yet very robust. I probably use it 80% of the time for anything more complicated than CSS transitions.

### **The team at GSAP**
Creator of <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_blank">GSAP: GreenSock Animation Platform</a>.
This is my go to library for complex animation timelines and very interactive components.
GSAP is also now free since Webflow purchased the company.
