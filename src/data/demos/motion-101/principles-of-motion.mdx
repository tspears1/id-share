## Where to begin? Why not look to the THEATRE!?

When starting to think about motion design, it can be helpful to look towards the world of the theatre and dance where much movement analysis and theory originated.
**Rudolf Laban**, a dance artist and theorist, developed a system for analyzing and categorizing human movement called _Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)_.

He began by examining four basic categories, commonly reffered to as the BESS System:
<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
- <small>_The What:_</small> **Body** - what is the body (or subject) and its parts doing?
- <small>_The How:_</small> **Effort** - what is the quality of the movement?
- <small>_The Why:_</small> **Shape** - how the body is changing shape and what motivates it to do so
- <small>_The Where:_</small> **Space** - where the body is moving and the harmonic relationships in space (or its container)
</div>

## The Efforts of Motion
Leban went on to further breakout his system by developing four pairs of _components_ that describe the effort of a movement:

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
- **Direction/Space** is either `direct` or `indirect`.
- **Weight** is either `heavy` or `light`.
- **Speed/Time** is either `quick` or `sustained`.
- **Flow** is either `bound` or `free`.
</div>

These four pairs were then used to create clear descriptive _actions_ called **THE EIGHT EFFORTS**:
<div class="grid-table" style="--grid-table-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);">
   <span>**Punch**</span><span>`Direct`</span><span>`Quick`</span><span>`Heavy`</span><span>`Bound`</span>
   <span>**Slash**</span><span>`Indirect`</span><span>`Quick`</span><span>`Heavy`</span><span>`Free`</span>
   <span>**Dab**</span><span>`Direct`</span><span>`Quick`</span><span>`Light`</span><span>`Bound`</span>
   <span>**Flick**</span><span>`Indirect`</span><span>`Quick`</span><span>`Light`</span><span>`Free`</span>
   <span>**Press**</span><span>`Direct`</span><span>`Sustained`</span><span>`Heavy`</span><span>`Bound`</span>
   <span>**Wring**</span><span>`Indirect`</span><span>`Sustained`</span><span>`Heavy`</span><span>`Bound`</span>
   <span>**Glide**</span><span>`Direct`</span><span>`Sustained`</span><span>`Light`</span><span>`Free`</span>
   <span>**Float**</span><span>`Indirect`</span><span>`Sustained`</span><span>`Light`</span><span>`Free`</span>
</div>

## BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A DANCER / ACTOR / PERFORMER!<br/> I BUILD WEBSITES! HOW IS THIS USEFUL???

These eight efforts are a great starting point for talking about motion design with a client or team. They provide a common language to describe the quality and feel of motion, which can be incredibly useful when trying to communicate ideas and concepts.
Here's some examples of these efforts used to describe various kinds of websites:

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl); display: grid; gap: 4vb;">
<div>
<small>_Punch_`Direct` `Quick` `Heavy` `Bound` </small>
### **Breaking‑news site**
Headlines snap in with sharp ease‑out; alerts hit hard and exit fast. Grid is rigid, hierarchy unmistakable, motion prioritizes urgency over charm.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Press_`Indirect` `Quick` `Heavy` `Free` </small>
### **Enterprise SaaS dashboard**
Weighty panels settle with slow ease‑in‑out; data updates push steadily, never jitter. Motion communicates reliability and consequence.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Dab_`Direct` `Quick` `Light` `Bound` </small>
### **Product feature microsite**
Tooltips and highlights pop in with crisp micro‑interactions; small distance, precise placement, quick easing that feels attentive rather than aggressive.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Glide_`Indirect` `Quick` `Light` `Free` </small>
### **Luxury fashion e‑commerce**
Carousels and lookbooks drift with silky ease‑out; transitions are elongated, frictionless, and placed to suggest polish and expense.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Slash_`Direct` `Quick` `Heavy` `Free` </small>
### **Creative agency portfolio**
Bold diagonals, off‑axis reveals, and energetic wipes; motion cuts across space to reframe content, signaling daring and editorial punch.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Wring_`Indirect` `Sustained` `Heavy` `Bound` </small>
### **Investigative longform or documentary site**
Dense sections compress and expand slowly; layered parallax and scroll‑bound motion suggest complexity, tension, and deliberation.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Flick_`Indirect` `Quick` `Light` `Free` </small>
### **Youth/entertainment promo microsite**
Stickers, badges, and UI bits flit in and out with elastic ease; playful, off‑trajectory motion implies spontaneity and fun.
</div>
<div>
<small>_Float_`Indirect` `Sustained` `Light` `Free` </small>
### **Meditation/wellness site**
Gentle drift, slow fades, and soft parallax; motion is breathable, unobtrusive
