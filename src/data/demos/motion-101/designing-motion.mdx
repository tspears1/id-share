## So how do these concept translate to code?

Once you've established _tone_ and _feel_ of your website, it's time to start thinking about how to bring that motion to life.

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
It's time for **CHOREOGRAPHY**!
</div>

## Oh no, not the theatre again...

When starting to think more technically about how to choreograph it's helpful to break motion down into a kinetic system:

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
- Duration ‚è≥
- Direction üß≠
- Easing / Rate of Change üåä
- Delay / Stagger ü™ú
- Repetition üîÅ
- Origin üéØ
</div>

These building blocks also happen to coinside with actual CSS properties of animation:

<div style="font-size: var(--font-size-xl);">
- `animation-duration` - Duration
- `animation-direction` - Direction
- `animation-timing-function` - Easing / Rate of Change
- `animation-delay` - Delay / Stagger
- `animation-iteration-count` - Repetition
</div>

## WHAT DO THESE THINGS MEAN??

### _Duration_
The total span of time a transition / animation takes from start to finish. It sets the temporal footprint and perceived weight of the motion.
In web design it's often expressed in seconds or milliseconds (my personal preference).

### _Direction_
Simply, the temporal flow or trajectory of the motion. Often indicated by `forwards`, `backwards`, or `alternate`.

### _Easing / Rate of Change_
Often expressed as a mathmatical function that describes the speed and acceleration of the motion over the established duration.
We'll cover this more in the next section.

### _Delay / Stagger_
A delay refers to the time between the start of one motion and the start of the next.
A stagger is a series of delays usually applied to a collection of elements that are animated together.

### _Repetition_
Does the motion play once, loop forever, or repeat a set number of times?
How can repetition or the lack thereof, reinforce our storytelling?

### _Origin_
When i think of origin, I'm reffering to the point in space and shape of the element at the start of the motion. Depending on an element's origin, a powerful **distance** is created between two values.


## I thought we were talking about ACTION? These all sould like TIME!

At it's core, motion is **movement/action** through **time**. So it makes sense that we often think about it in context to a _TIMELINE_:
a representation of the sequence of events from start to finish, often including **keyframes** or changes in state.
