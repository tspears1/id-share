import { Sandbox } from '@components/molecules/Sandbox/Sandbox.jsx'

With some many recent advancements in CSS, there's certainly a camp of people ready to throw out pre-proccesors like SASS/SCSS or LESS and go completely **vanilla**.
We're close but IMO not _quite_ there yet.

There are a few things that CSS on it's own still **can't give us**:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(18ch, 1fr)); gap: 1rem;">
<div>
- ~Variables~ üòé
- ~Nesting~ ü™∫
- ~Calculations~ üßÆ
- ~Trig Functions~ ü§ì
- ~Color Functions~ üé®
</div>
<div>
- Variables in Media Queries ü§î
- Lists ‚òπÔ∏è
- Custom Functions üòí
- Mixins ü•∫
- Conditionals üò©
</div>

## That's actually a pretty impressive list!

However, some features, like `color-functions` just barely have full support and certainly not enough that I would start to use them in production.

As a rule of thumb I tend to use CSS Variables over SCSS variables for everything **except** for `colors` & `breakpoints`.

## Colors

There are still so many incredible color functions in SCSS that we don't have yet in modern CSS _or at least not fully supported_. So I typically create all my colors as SCS Variables first, that way they're available if i need them.

**However**, I still establish them in a `list` that I can then loop through a mixin to generate CSS Variable versions of each. 95% of the time I'm actually just using the CSS Variable version but its incredibly useful to star them with SCSS.

```scss
$colors: (
	sky-blue: 189 97% 46%,
	dark-blue: 195 47% 15%,
	bu-red: 0 100% 40%,
	off-white: 180 6% 97%,
	navy-blue: 203 25% 17%,
	'black': 0 0% 0%,
	'white': 0 0% 100%,
);

// Generate CSS Variables
:where(html) {
   // ex. --color-sky-blue: hsl(189 97% 46%);
   @include generate-color-variables($colors);

   // ex. --color-sky-blue-hsl: 189 97% 46%;
   @include generate-color-variables-hsl($colors);
}

// Then if I REALLY need to use the SCSS variable:
.card {
   background-color: luminance( hsl( map.get( $colors, sky-blue ) ) );
}
```

## Breakpoints

I follow a similar pattern with `breakpoints` - at this point in time you can not use css vars as the value in media queries ie `@media (min-inline-size: var(--breakpoint-xs)) { ... }`.

There are specs to change this, as well as add support for querying BY style/variable ü§Ø \
ie. `@container style(--theme: dark) { ... }`

So for now breakpoints also get defined as SCSS variables. But again I find it useful to store them in css variables as well.

```scss
$breakpoints: (
   base: 0,
   xs: 320px,
   sm: 640px,
   md: 768px,
   lg: 1024px,
   xl: 1280px
)

:where(html) {
   // ex. --breakpoint-xs: 320px;
   @include mix.generate-breakpoint-widths(config.$breakpoints);
   // ex.
   // @media (min-width: 320px) {
   //    --breakpoint-min-width: 320px;
   //    --breakpoint-max-width: 639px;
   // }
   @include mix.generate-active-breakpoint-variables(config.$breakpoints);
}
```

## Functions & Mixins
So if all the variables are CSS Variables, how do we use them in SCSS functions and mixins?

With **functions**, we often can't - because the css var is compiled on the client-side and the function is executed during the build. (But I also find myself using functions less and less).

However most **mixins** aren't running any kind of calculations on build, so we can in fact use CSS Variables as arguments, BUT we have to _escape_ or **interpolate** the values:

```scss
.card {
   @include heading-1($line-height: #{var(--line-height-1)});
}
```

We can also store CSS Variables as SCSS Variables _very useful for integrating them into Responsive foundation_:

```scss
$font-family-serif: #{var(--font-heading)};
```
